![feedback](../static/reportImg/feedback.png)

Q3:  9/20 have pets and only one pet for each person.  11/20 do not have pets.

Q4: 12/20 people have plan to adopt new pets.

Q5: 16/20 people have not surfed any online pet stores before as they prefer to go to offline stores more. 
Consumers do not quite believe in the credibility of the online platforms and show very limited acceptance on this new type of pet shopping. Therefore our group plan to make the webpage pet info present & search only and leave trade & contact information in the footnote. In this way, customers can contact shop owner directly after they see sth they interested in and make purchase thereafter.
